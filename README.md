Build Web-based Interactive Visualization Data Models using D3
In order to get up and running on a local development server do the following:
* Install http-server: ```npm i http-server -g```
* Run the following command in the root folder of this repository:
```http-server```

The app will then be live [here](http://127.0.0.1:8080) (or elsewhere if port 8080 is already in use)!
